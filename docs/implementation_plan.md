### **Implementation Plan for Benchmarking on HPC**

**Goal:** Compare your framework’s performance against PyTorch/Horovod for small tasks (e.g., MNIST/CIFAR-10) on an HPC system.

---

### **1. Stage 1: Setup HPC Environment (1 Week)**

**Objective:** Prepare your HPC cluster and tools.  
**Tasks:**

1. **Access HPC Resources:**
   - Request a small GPU/CPU partition (e.g., 2–4 nodes).
   - Learn basic Slurm commands to submit jobs (e.g., `sbatch`, `srun`).
2. **Install Software:**
   - Install PyTorch, OpenMPI, CUDA, and Horovod (for comparison).
   - Use conda or Singularity containers to manage dependencies.
3. **Validate Setup:**
   - Run a simple PyTorch DDP/Horovod example (e.g., MNIST training).
   - Test MPI with a “Hello World” script across nodes.

**Deliverables:**

- Working HPC environment with PyTorch, MPI, and CUDA.
- A validated MNIST training script using PyTorch DDP.

### **2. Stage 2: Implement Your Framework (4 Weeks)**

**Objective:** Build your framework’s core components.

#### **Step 2.1: Parallel Data Loading with OpenMP (1 Week)**

- **Task:**
  - Use OpenMP to parallelize data loading and augmentation (e.g., MNIST).
  - Example: Split dataset into chunks and process with multiple threads.
- **Deliverable:**
  - Data loader that reads 10,000 MNIST samples/sec (baseline: PyTorch DataLoader).

#### **Step 2.2: Distributed Training with MPI (1.5 Weeks)**

- **Task:**
  - Use MPI to split a batch across nodes (e.g., 4 nodes → 4 sub-batches).
  - Implement forward/backward passes on each node.
- **Deliverable:**
  - A simple CNN model training on MNIST across 2–4 nodes.

#### **Step 2.3: GPU Acceleration with CUDA (1 Week)**

- **Task:**
  - Port the model’s compute-heavy ops (e.g., matrix multiplication) to CUDA.
  - Use PyTorch’s CUDA tensors as a reference.
- **Deliverable:**
  - GPU-accelerated training loop (compare speed vs. CPU-only).

#### **Step 2.4: Gradient Synchronization (0.5 Weeks)**

- **Task:**
  - Aggregate gradients across nodes using `MPI_Allreduce`.
  - Compare with PyTorch’s `torch.distributed.all_reduce()`.
- **Deliverable:**
  - Working gradient sync with minimal MPI latency.

#### **Step 2.5: Checkpointing (0.5 Weeks)**

- **Task:**
  - Save model weights every 5 epochs to a shared filesystem (e.g., Lustre).
  - Ensure saving doesn’t block training.
- **Deliverable:**
  - Model checkpoints that can resume training.

### **3. Stage 3: Integrate and Test (1.5 Weeks)**

**Objective:** Combine all components and debug.  
**Tasks:**

1. **End-to-End Workflow:**
   - Run: Data loading (OpenMP) → Training (MPI + CUDA) → Checkpointing.
2. **Debug Common Issues:**
   - Fix MPI deadlocks, GPU memory leaks, or data loader bottlenecks.
3. **Validate Correctness:**
   - Ensure the model’s accuracy matches PyTorch’s single-node results.

**Deliverable:**

- A working framework that trains MNIST to ~99% accuracy on 2–4 nodes.

---

### **4. Stage 4: Benchmark Against PyTorch (1.5 Weeks)**

**Objective:** Measure performance vs. PyTorch DDP/Horovod.  
**Tasks:**

1. **Define Metrics:**
   - **Training Time per Epoch** (your framework vs. PyTorch).
   - **GPU/CPU Utilization** (use `nvidia-smi` or `htop`).
   - **Communication Overhead** (time spent in `MPI_Allreduce`).
2. **Run Experiments:**
   - Train MNIST on 1, 2, and 4 nodes with both frameworks.
   - Use the same hyperparameters (batch size, learning rate).
3. **Analyze Results:**
   - Plot scaling efficiency (e.g., speedup with more nodes).
   - Identify bottlenecks (e.g., data loading vs. gradient sync).

**Deliverable:**

- A report showing your framework’s performance relative to PyTorch.

---

### **5. Stage 5: Document and Share (1 Week)**

**Objective:** Make your work reproducible.  
**Tasks:**

1. **Write a User Guide:**
   - Explain how to run your framework (e.g., Slurm script example).
2. **Publish Code:**
   - Share code on GitHub with a `README.md` and example scripts.
3. **Summarize Findings:**
   - Create a 1-page summary of benchmarks and lessons learned.

**Deliverable:**

- GitHub repo with code, scripts, and documentation.

### **Key Tools & Commands**

- **Slurm Script Example:**
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  #SBATCH --nodes=2
  #SBATCH --gres=gpu:2
  #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=2
  mpirun -np 4 python train.py --dataset=MNIST
  ```
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Training time: `time python train.py`
  - GPU usage: `nvidia-smi --loop=1`
  - MPI profiling: `mpirun -np 4 --report-bindings python train.py`

### **Risks & Mitigation**

- **HPC Access Issues:** Start early and test small jobs first.
- **MPI Deadlocks:** Use `MPI_Barrier()` for debugging.
- **Slow Data Loading:** Preload datasets into RAM or use SSDs.

This plan focuses on simplicity and actionable steps. Adjust based on your HPC’s policies (e.g., GPU availability).
